                    Marideth loves listening to K-pop music and watching K-dramas and Korean variety shows. It helps her to relax when doing these things. She fell in love with K-pop when she was in 7th grade and eventually became a multi-stan to different K-pop groups, especially the girl group Twice. She was also introduced by her friends to Seventeen, which is a boy group, and she became a fan in an instant. Her love for her K-pop idols undoubtedly makes her very happy.

                <p class="description">
                    Marideth also attended the recent concert of Twice at Philippine Arena, which was held at Bulacan. It was her first time attending her favorite K-pop girl-group's concert. Listening to Twice's songs as well as other groups saved her from being sad and overwhelmed by hardships. Twice became her light to overcome her problems and became her comfort in all times. She buys K-pop merch and concert tickets and creates memorable experiences with her co-fans who became her friends.
